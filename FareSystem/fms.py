"""
Field Management System (FMS) state and periodic loop.

Responsibilities:
- Hold shared match state (number, duration, running window).
- Own the authoritative lists of teams and fares.
- Provide a thread-safe periodic() loop that:
  - Advances each fareâ€™s state machine (pickup/dropoff/payment).
  - Spawns new fares using fare_gen when below TARGET_FARES, throttled by do_generation().
- Expose small helpers to configure/start/cancel a match.

Threading:
- All access to shared state (fares, teams, match* vars) should be under `mutex`.
- periodic() is intended to run on a background thread.
